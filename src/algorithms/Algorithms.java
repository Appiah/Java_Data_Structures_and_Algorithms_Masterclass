    /* Types of Algorithms : Classifications are done based on the problem
    * the algorithm is solving.
    *
    *
    * 1. Simple recursive algorithms : { iterative, recursive }
    *
    * Recursive thinking is really important in programming and it helps you
    * break down big problems into smaller ones and easier to use.
    *
    * We cannot replace recursion with iteration always. Sometimes iteration
    * is far better and faster compared to recursion.
    *
    * When to choose recursion ?
    * a. if you can divide the problem into similar sub problems
    * b. Design an algorithm to compute nth . . .
    * c. Write code to list the n . . .
    * d. Implement a method to compute all
    *
    * Recursion in used more in data structures like trees and graphs
    *
    *
    * 2. Divide and conquer algorithms : { Divide the problem into smaller subproblems of the same type, and solve these subproblems recursively,
    * then combine the solutions to the subproblems into a solution to the original problem. eg. Quick sort and merge sort }
    *
    * 3. Dynamic programming algorithms : { They work based on memoization to find the best solution }
    *
    * 4. Greedy algorithms : { We take the best we can without worrying about the future consequencies. And
    * We hope that by choosing a local optimum solution at each step, we will end up at a global optimum solution. }
    *
    * 5. Brute force algorithms : { We try all the possibilities until a satisfactory solution is found }
    *
    * 6. Randomized algorithms : { eg. Using a random number at least once during the computation to make a decision }
